# BuyXGetYFreeApp

Implemented logic for BuyXGetYFree Offer.
Given the quantity, the program should output the free and payable quantity for the customer
e.g., If its Buy2Get1Free offer and the quantity is 7, the output should be free quantity = 2 and payable
quantity = 5

I have implemented the solution in a couple of languages, English(en) and Spanish(es). I have made code modular so that other languages can be added and other features can be easily introduced. 
The Following Screenshot shows how to run it in spanish and english:

Basic implementation of unit tests for minimising regression breaks and better logger in case something goes wrong.
